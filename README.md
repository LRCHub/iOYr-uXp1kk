[00:00.02] Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-oh
[00:01.61] Woo-hoo-hoo-ho-ooh-ooh-ooh
[00:08.32] Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-ooh
[00:09.99] Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh
[00:23.49] 
[00:17.87] Somewhere beneath the surface
[00:23.75] I wanna find if you're the problem or the purpose
[00:31.84] 'Cause it's borderline
[00:33.81] Never know if you're sorry for what you said
[00:40.95] For all I know you adore me
[00:44.80] But keep it all inside your head
[01:00.80] 
[00:49.58] Just a little more time, was it really that hard to do
[00:55.36] It was all I ever asked of you
[00:59.48] It was all I ever asked of you
[01:02.55] (Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-ooh, woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh)
[01:06.69] Nothing compares to the trouble that I've been through
[01:11.83] It was all I ever asked of you
[01:16.16] It was all I ever asked of you (You)
[01:19.66] (Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-ooh, woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh)
[01:44.66] 
[01:23.62] (Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-ooh)
[01:25.06] You gave up on me too easily
[01:30.26] I'd always try to make it right
[01:33.23] Even though you never wanted apologies
[01:38.68] You think I'm a liar
[01:40.65] Never know if I'm sorry for what I said
[01:47.80] I hope you know I adored you
[01:51.62] So many words are left unsaid
[02:06.12] 
[01:56.14] Just a little more time, was it really that hard to do
[02:02.08] It was all I ever asked of you
[02:06.25] It was all I ever asked of you (You)
[02:09.34] (Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-ooh, woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh)
[02:13.43] Nothing compares to the trouble that I've been through
[02:18.78] It was all I ever asked of you
[02:22.95] It was all I ever asked of you (You)
[02:26.25] (Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-ooh, woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh)
[02:51.25] 
[02:30.18] Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-ooh
[02:32.13] Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh
[02:36.72] (All I ever asked of you)
[02:38.61] Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-ooh
[02:40.45] Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh
[02:53.95] 
[02:46.16] Just a little more time, was it really that hard to do
[02:52.13] It was all I ever asked of you (You)
[02:56.33] It was all I ever asked of you
[03:00.34] (Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-ooh, woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh)
[03:03.52] Nothing compares to the trouble that I've been through
[03:08.87] It was all I ever asked of you
[03:13.23] It was all I ever asked of you (You)
[03:17.04] (Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-ooh, woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh)
[03:42.04] 
[03:19.84] Just a little more time, was it really that hard to do?
[03:25.69] It was all I ever asked of you
[03:29.86] It was all I ever asked of you
